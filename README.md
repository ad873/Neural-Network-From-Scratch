# Neural Network From Scratch

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a neural network from scratch, designed to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and mechanisms behind neural networks. The project covers various aspects including architecture, weight initialization, forward and backward propagation, and optimization techniques.

## Features
- Custom neural network architecture
- Implementation of activation functions
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Weight initialization techniques
- Example applications and use cases

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```
